# INIM0038
All scripts are my own work.
Scripts growth.curve.kptc.R and growth.curve.ktc.R were used to prepare Tuba-seq mice experimental data, calculate and plot log-normalised  relative growth rates for KPTC and KTC tumours from the 50th to 99.9th percentile.
Code in clinical.correlation.R were used to prepare data and perform analyses for: overall survival, lesion size pathology, genomic growth data, genomic instability data, RNAseq data and immunology data, and compare context-dependent growth rates.
Code in co-occurrence.R were used to perform correlations between mouse tumour growth advantage in KPTC background and TSG/TP53-deficiency co-occurrence enrichment in human tumour databases: TCGA, TRACERx and GENIE.
Packages required: bindrcpp, boot, datasets, dplyr, forcats, ggplot2, ggpubr, gplots, graphics, grDevices, magrittr, methods, purrr, readr, rlang, stas, stats4, stringr, survival, survminer, tibble, tidyr, tidyverse, utils.
