All scripts are my own work.
Scripts growth.curve.kptc.R and growth.curve.ktc.R were used to prepare and plot log-normalised to inert, relative growth curves for KPTC and KTC tumours from the 50th to 99.9th percentile.
Scripts in clinical.correlation.R were used to prepare data and perform analyses for: overall survival, lesion size pathology, genomic growth data, genomic instability data, RNAseq data and immunology data.
Scripts in co-occurrence.R were used to perform correlations between tuba-seq growth advantage and co-occurrence enrichment in databases: TCGA, TRACERx and GENIE.
